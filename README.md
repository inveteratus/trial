# Trial

Slow but usable trial division of large numbers using primegen.

## Usage:

```
trial <number> [<from>]
```

## Output

```
trial: <number> is composite (<factor1> x <factor2>)
trial: <number> is composite
trial: <number> is prime
trial: <number> is probably prime
```

N.B. factor1 will be prime, factor2 make be composite or prime.
